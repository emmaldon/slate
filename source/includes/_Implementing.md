## Billing Portal

PayStand provides every partner with a Billing Portal; an instance of checkout configured for their account, found a static URL. Also known as a Payment Page, a Checkout Page, and (every so often) a Preset (in that every Billing Portal has a "preset set of conditions").

Partners use their Billing Portals in invoices, emails, embed in their websites, and sometimes just direct their customers to the URL separately as a convenient way to accept a payment.
